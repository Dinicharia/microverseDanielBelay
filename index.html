            <a id ="tribute-link" href="#" target="_blank"></a>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1914</strong>-Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
              <li><strong>1933</strong>-Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the
              "National Youth Administration"</li>
              <li><strong>1935</strong>-Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
              how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
              <li><strong>1937</strong>-Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
              <li><strong>1941</strong>-Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
              work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
              <li><strong>1942</strong>-Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
              <li><strong>1944</strong>-Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
              pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat -
              including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
              <li><strong>1945</strong>-Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
              <li><strong>1953</strong>-crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well
              to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat</li>
              <li><strong>1962</strong>-Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass
              starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
